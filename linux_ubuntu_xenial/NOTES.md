# Personal Notes

On Kubuntu 16.04 on ASUS Zenbook UX305, this is what I have found:

* Cannot encrypt drive, doesn't remember password
* Wi-Fi is broken, cannot authenticate
* Problems with external monitor
  * initially worked, but then after log-on, external display disappears and is not detected
* Plasma application continually crashes
